# Requirements for Nexus Dashboard Pre-upgrade Validation Script
# 
# This file lists all Python dependencies required to run the ND-Preupgrade-Validation.py script
# and its worker functions. Most dependencies are part of Python's standard library.
#
# IMPORTANT SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (NOT INSTALLABLE VIA PIP):
# These are command-line tools that must be available in the system PATH:
#
# - sshpass: Required for SSH password authentication
#   Installation:
#     Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): sudo apt-get install sshpass
#     Linux (RHEL/CentOS):   sudo yum install sshpass
#     macOS (Homebrew):      brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
#     Windows:               Use WSL or Git Bash with sshpass
#
# - ssh: SSH client for secure remote connections (usually pre-installed)
# - scp: Secure copy for file transfers (usually comes with ssh)
# - tar: Archive extraction tool (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - gzip/gunzip: Compression utilities (usually pre-installed)
# - find: File search utility (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - grep: Text search utility (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - awk: Text processing tool (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - ps: Process status utility (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - kill/pkill: Process termination utilities (usually pre-installed)
# - hostname: System hostname utility (usually pre-installed)
# - df: Disk space utility (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
# - netstat: Network statistics utility (usually pre-installed)
# - which: Command location utility (usually pre-installed on Unix/Linux)
#
# Most of these tools are standard on Linux/Unix systems. On Windows, consider
# using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for full compatibility.
#
# Python Package Dependencies:
# For Python 2.7 compatibility (worker script on older ND nodes):
ipaddr>=2.2.0; python_version<"3.0"

# For Python 3+ compatibility (worker script on newer ND nodes):
ipaddress; python_version>="3.0"

# Note: The following modules are part of Python's standard library and don't need to be installed:
# - re (regular expressions)
# - subprocess (process management) 
# - threading (threading support)
# - platform (platform identification)
# - socket (network sockets)
# - time (time-related functions)
# - sys (system parameters)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - json (JSON encoder/decoder)
# - math (mathematical functions)
# - shlex (shell-like lexical analysis)
# - getpass (password input without echo)
# - glob (Unix shell-style pathname pattern expansion)
# - signal (signal handling)
# - tempfile (temporary file/directory creation)
# - traceback (exception traceback printing)
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - logging (flexible logging system)
# - datetime (date and time handling)
# - concurrent.futures (high-level threading interface)
# - select (I/O multiplexing)
# - atexit (exit handlers)
